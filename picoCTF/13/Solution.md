# Solution
- This task is very basic too, we just need to decode ROT13 with an already given flag. You can use different online tools to do that, or write a basic Python script that will do all of it for you. Some basic tools will be:

- https://rot13.com/
- https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder

- After doing this, you will get your flag.
